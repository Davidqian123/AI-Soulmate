### Introduction

This project is an interactive AI character with voice input, voice output, and profile image generationâ€”all running locally with Nexa SDK and powered by Llama3 Uncensored Model. It offers two options for voice output: using the **Bark** model for on-device text-to-speech or the **OpenAI TTS API** for cloud-based text-to-speech. **Bark** will be slow to generate speech without using GPU, but it's on device. The **OpenAI TTS API** has the advantage in terms of speed, but it is cloud-based and requires you to have an OPENAI API KEY. Each option is designed to provide flexibility based on the user's resources and preferences.You can also choose other options according to your preference.

- Key features:

  - Voice in, voice out
  - Local image generation
  - Uncensored model
  - No privacy concerns

- File structure:

  - `bark_voice_out/app.py`: main Streamlit app using Bark for voice output
  - `bark_voice_out/utils/initialize.py`: initializes chat and load model
  - `bark_voice_out/utils/gen_avatar.py`: generates avatar for AI Soulmate
  - `bark_voice_out/utils/transcribe.py`: handles voice input to text transcription
  - `bark_voice_out/utils/gen_response.py`: handles text and voice output

  - `openai_voice_out/app.py`: main Streamlit app using OpenAI TTS API for voice output
